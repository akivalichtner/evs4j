EVS4J 1.0b3
-----------

Incorrectly handled case of 2 network adapters. Should have forced user to
specify one, but didn't. Fixed.

Paul Kendall and Samant Maharaj sent in a patch for two bugs, one being a bug in
the code that collected free nodes in the message buffer and put them back in the
free list (a 6-line change) and the other a bug in updating the last safe message id.
Legal note: on 3/2/2006 Paul assigned the copyright to me (Guglielmo Lichtner) on
behalf of himself and Samant Maharaj.

EVS4J 1.0b2
-----------

On Linux 2.6.x with ipv6 support the nic-finding code threw an exception. Fixed.

On Windows XP when you bring an adapter down it seem to disappear entirely.
Added code to report to handle this case more informatively.

In SRPRecovery.java there was a FIXME about delivering messages from the
transitional processors _only_. Fixed.

EVS4J 1.0b1
-----------

First release since around January 2004 (0.9.1).

Deprecated EVS4J project in SourceForge because it uses CVS which is
hard to administer. I am using my own Subversion repository now. I have
removed a lot of code and done some refactorings to simplify the system
as much as possible.

Changed the license. This code is now licensed under the Apache License,
version 2.0.
